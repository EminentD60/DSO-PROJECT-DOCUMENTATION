# DSO-PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION

## **Project Outline**
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the property market trends in Lagos, Nigeria for the year 2022. By analyzing the various parameters within this dataset, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform decision-making within the real estate industry.  Our analysis will focus on uncovering trends, identifying high-performing areas, and understanding buyer preferences.  These insights will then be used to craft compelling data stories that effectively communicate our findings.

## Project Source
The dataset for this project was obtained from a Nigerian real estate company called PropertyPro NG (https://www.propertypro.ng/). The extracted dataset contained information about real estate properties (land, homes, commercial buildings such as shops and offices) across four different cities in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2022.
